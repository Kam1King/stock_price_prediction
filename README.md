Welcome to our real-time stock price prediction web application! This application leverages the power of various technologies to provide users with accurate and up-to-date predictions of stock prices.

We utilize the yfinance library, a powerful Python package that allows us to easily retrieve and manipulate stock market data from Yahoo Finance. With yfinance, we can access a wide range of financial data including historical market data, stock prices, trading volumes, and more. This enables our application to fetch real-time stock price data directly from Yahoo Finance, ensuring that our predictions are based on the latest market information.

For the backend of our application, we utilize Flask, a lightweight and versatile web framework for Python. Flask provides the infrastructure needed to handle HTTP requests, manage sessions, and render dynamic web pages. With Flask, we can efficiently serve our machine learning model and handle user interactions, ensuring a seamless and responsive experience for our users.

On the frontend, we leverage the Dash library, which is built on top of Flask and Plotly, to create interactive and visually appealing data visualizations. Dash allows us to build web-based analytical applications with Python, enabling us to display stock price predictions, historical data charts, and other relevant information in a user-friendly manner.

To make predictions, we employ a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, a powerful supervised learning algorithm that is well-suited for classification and regression tasks. SVM works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes or, in our case, predicts continuous values such as stock prices. By training our SVM model on historical stock market data, we can generate accurate predictions of future stock prices.

Our web application provides users with a simple and intuitive interface for querying stock prices, viewing historical data, and accessing real-time predictions. Whether you're a seasoned investor looking for insights or a novice interested in learning more about stock market trends, our application has something to offer for everyone.

We hope you find our real-time stock price prediction web application valuable and informative. Feel free to explore the features, interact with the data visualizations, and make use of the predictive capabilities to enhance your investment decisions. Thank you for using our application, and we welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have to improve our platform further. Happy investing!
